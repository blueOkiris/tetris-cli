![screenshot](docs/img/screenshot.png)

Install with `cargo install tetris-cli`

Requires a Linux or other \*nix Terminal (i.e. won't work in Windows Terminal)

Available for Arch on the AUR as [tetris-cli-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tetris-terminal-git)

and on NetBSD [tetris-cli](https://pkgsrc.se/games/tetris-cli) from the official repositories.

## Controls

+ a -> Move left
+ d -> Move right
+ q -> Rotate left
+ e -> Rotate right
+ s -> Instant drop
+ p -> Pause
+ Backspace -> Quit

## Build dependencies

You should just need the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed and a \*nix machine (Windows cmd is bad when it comes to terminal graphics).
