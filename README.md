(Linux only!)

## Controls

 + a -> Move left

 + d -> Move right
 
 + q -> Rotate left
 
 + e -> Rotate right
 
 + s -> Drop faster
 
 + Backspace -> Quit

## Build dependencies

You should just need the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed and a Linux machine (Windows cmd is bad when it comes to terminal graphics).
